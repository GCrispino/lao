LAO* IA planning algorithm implementation

This repository contains a implementation for the LAO* algorithm (defined by [Hansen and Zilberstein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370201001060)).

## Running
To get instructions on how to execute the program, run the following:

```bash
$ python main.py --help
```

Two environment files are provided as examples (two grid world test examples) in `env-paper.json` and `env1.json`.

## Testing
There is also a test suite defined in the `test` folder that can be run with `pytest`.
